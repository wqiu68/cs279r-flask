REFLECTION: What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that each previous set of technologies did not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

One of the key features of Flask is the fact that it is written in Python. It is pretty much a web application framework written in Python. And Python is much easier tha JavaScript or PHP therefore this increases the easibility of understanding and using Flask. One key feature of Flask is that Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if it was done of Flask itself (when it actuality, it is through a 3rd party). Flask is a very easy, intuitive web application framework to use especially when wanting to use something simple. Because of Flask's simplicity, some of the biggest companies we know use Flask: Netflix, Reddit, Airbnb, Lyft, Uber etc. One should use Flask if they want to learn the backend of programming quickly because it allows you to feel the experience of Flask. Although options like Firebase might be a bit more useful if you are focused on ensuring that your end product be complex and have more understanding of backend already.
